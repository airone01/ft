## Subject interpretation

The subject for this particular project contradicts itself on multiple points, so after a talk with the other students, we all collectively decided to deliver it in a specific way.
The Makefiles that were inside the project during defense in particular were subject of interpretation.
You won't see them here, as I just use bazel for this monorepo.
