## Info

This is my render for NetPractice.

Because I had a session problem, most of my files were deleted, so I backed up those.
I have no idea if they're up to date for the project, or if they were exported when I fully finished the level they correspond to.

You can't use them anyways, because the seed of the project is your 42 login.
So they're here pretty much for decoration only.
